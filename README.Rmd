# BalKmeans

The goal of BalKmeans is to implement balanced K-Means algorithm where the minimum and maximum number of observations in each cluster and also the power ratings of each observation are taken as constraints. Optimal group of observations are developed along with balancing of imbalanced observations.

## Installation

You can install the released version of BalKmeans from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("BalKmeans")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
